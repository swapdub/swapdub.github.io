	<p>Some friends who spent time teaching and helping me improve</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			George Petrou
			<h5>
				We met in PSU during my enrollment in the club PSUAS in the Spring
				Semester of 2020. I chose computer vision as the team I would want to
				be involved in. George was the team lead. I barely had any background
				in coding up to that point. So George divide each meeting session with
				the first half of him teaching us and the second half helping us
				incorporate what we learned for the computer vision module. We were
				using an NVIDEA Tegra K1 Development board for processing the images
				from 2 4k-resolution cameras. He introduced me to the fundamentals of
				how compilers worked, how we code for multiple threads and much more!
				I would be forever thankful to George for dedicating so much time for
				me. His initial training allowed me to become an independant learner
				and grow into the field of software development.

			Prof. David N. Burrows
			<h4>
				I took his class Astro 320: Observational Astronomy Laboratory during
				Fall 2016. This has been probably the only class I have remembered in
				all these years. Prof. Burrows was a calm and involved teacher throughout
				the semester. The class had many labs where we would need to control
				the Telescopes atop Davey Lab. Each obervation would last atleast 3-4
				hours during the State College winter with temperatures going below 0
				degree Celcius during some night! He would stay with us to help for
				those late night hours, guiding us through the technologies relevant
				in astronomy and conversing about our love for the subject. I
				appreciate his efforts in turning a difficult subject into one I
				looked forward to every week.
			</h4>
		</li>
		<h3>Relevant technologies used:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><h4>Camera and CCD technology</li>
			<li><h4>Telescope and their guiding mechanism</li>
			<li><h4>Using IDLE</li>
			<li><h4>Analysing ".FITS" files obtained from telescope observations</li>
