    <h1>Windows Scripting</h1>
    </ul>
    <p>I recently got the urge to try automating Windows. The idea had been floating in my mind for a while now, pushed
        by this ad of a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Udemy
            course</a> pushing me to automate the boring stuff in my life by making itself free every other week. So, I
        finally caved and have found a problem relevant to me to work on. Automating opening and logging into my games.
        Being an international student myself, and having friends spread out across the globe. While in general the
        internet has been a boon for people sitting at home and tinkering their life away while getting to enjoy playing
        games, some companies seem to want to particularly annoy you by making something difficult that should be easy
        (RIOT GAMES!! ðŸ˜¡).

        <h2>Problem:</h2>

        So obviously ðŸ™„, I need to have 2 accounts for different regions which means I can not use "Keep me Signed in"
        since I have to constantly switch and their ancient client can not handle saving multiple account logins.
        Therefore the objective is.

        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        Have a script that would open a program, wait for it to load, and type in the relevant credentials. And I just
        make 2 of those scripts, one for each region that I play on.

        <h2>Process:</h2>
        Of the many options I could choose, I went with a batch script since that required the minimum overhead,
        basically no installation. Using Python would require too many installations and while it does seem to be more
        versatile, I think my use case does not justify such a big program.
        <br>
        <br>
        My research got me to
